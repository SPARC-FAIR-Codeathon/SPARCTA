## Introduction
Okay isnt it a bummer when you want to see some files on SPARC but somehow you ended up how to download it? What if I just want to do a quick preview

## Problem Definition
- In the current version of SPARC Portal Users are unable to view TIFF images directly in the browser; they must download them first. This can be inconvenient, especially when users might want a quick look at the image without needing to download it.
- Please mention about BioLucida Viewer and its limitation (Please help research)
- Please highlight on the annotation limitation
- Please highlight on the importance collaboration (Other people from the same group if they're given an access they can see the annotated tiff files to, allowing collaboration)

## Solution
(Please rephrase in a way that we're offering them a solution) SPARCTA will allow the user to perform the following task:
- **Preview**: Users can preview TIFF image without having to download it first
- **Annotation**: Users can annotate microscopy images and save their annotations.
- **Comments**: Users can leave comments directly on the image.
- **Full Screen Mode**: Users can go into full screen mode and this allows for detailed examination by expanding the image to full screen.
- **Zoom and Pan**: Users can zoom in, zoom out, pan across the image, crop it, and save the final result.
- **Image Adjustments**: Users can adjust the brightness, saturation, and other settings of the image.
